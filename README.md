# Subscan

The open source version of [subscan.io][subscan]

This repo has long time no updates because our team were busy with upgrading [subscan.io][subscan] for 
[darwinia][darwina] last days.

Subscan will catch up the progress of [subscan.io][subscan] soon, **early in June** if everything works fine,
after that, appreciating for your contributions!
